		<p> We have officially acquired the permits to start <br>
			construction in Toril! We will be building housing <br>
			starting north working our way down south. We are SO <br>
			excited for this project and we thank everyone so much <br>
			for all the support we've received in our announcement! <br>
			All of it has deeply encouraged and motivated us to <br>
			continue working hard for these communities. For those <br>
			who enlisted, see you there!
